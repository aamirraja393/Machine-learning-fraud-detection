# Machine-learning-fraud-detection

This repository contains the code for my Data Science MSc dissertation, titled "Using machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions."

In this project, I explored a plethora of machine learning techniques and utilised hyperparameter optimization to compare the performance of various models. The goal was to identify the most effective model for detecting fraudulent transactions using a Kaggle dataset.

Machine Learning Models Explored
XGBoost
Random Forest
Logistic Regression
K-Means Clustering

GridSearchCV is then applied as the method for determining the optimal hyperparameter split for my XGBoost and Random forest models, as they perform the best at fraudlent transaction detection.
