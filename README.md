# Machine-learning-fraud-detection

# This repository contains the code for me Data Science MSc dissertation which is titled using Machine learning to detect fraudlent transactions. This was a project where I examined a plethora of machine learning techniques and deployed hyperparameter optimisation to compare the results of various machine learning models to identify the most effective model for fraud transaction detection for my Kaggle dataset.
