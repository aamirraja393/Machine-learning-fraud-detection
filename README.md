# Machine-learning-fraud-detection

This repository contains the code for my Data Science MSc dissertation, titled "Using machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions."

In this project, I explored a plethora of machine learning techniques and utilised hyperparameter optimization to compare the performance of various models. The goal was to identify the most effective model for detecting fraudulent transactions using a Kaggle dataset.
